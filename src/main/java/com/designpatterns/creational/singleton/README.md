# Singleton Pattern

Singleton Pattern is probably the most widely used design pattern. It is a simple pattern, easy to understand and to use. Sometimes it is used in excess and in scenarios where it is not required. In such cases, the disadvantages of using it outweigh the advantages it brings. For this reason, the singleton pattern is sometimes considered an antipattern or pattern singleton.
