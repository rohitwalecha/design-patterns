# Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that enables the creation of new objects by copying an existing object. Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing object rather than create a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object.
