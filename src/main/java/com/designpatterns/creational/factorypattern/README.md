# Factory Pattern

The factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is useful when you need to decouple the creation of an object from its implementation.

The idea is to create a factory class with a single responsibility to create objects, hiding the details of class modules from the user.
A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an object, allowing clients to create objects of a library(explained below) in a way such that it doesnâ€™t have a tight coupling with the class hierarchy of the library.
